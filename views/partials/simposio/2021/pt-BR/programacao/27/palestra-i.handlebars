          <b>Abstract:</b> Computer science (CS) education research is of growing relevance because of the growing need for computer scientists and an informed public who understands the computational world around them. As a relatively young field, CS and CS education are primed for innovation and impact, and CS education research can be a primary driver of developing effective and equitable CS education. CS education research has important connections with other CS sub-disciplines like HCI, software engineering, and programming languages, and has additional connections to non-CS disciplines like cognitive science, psychology, and education. Drawing from her own and others’ CS education research, Lewis will illustrate recent innovations and impacts from CS education research.

          <b>Bio:</b> Colleen Lewis is an Assistant Professor of computer science (CS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Lewis was previously the McGregor-Girand Associate Professor of CS at  Harvey Mudd College. At the University of California, Berkeley, Lewis completed a PhD in science and mathematics education, an MS in computer science, and a BS in electrical engineering and computer science. Her research seeks to identify and remove barriers to CS learning and understand and optimize CS learning. Lewis curates CSTeachingTips.org, a project for disseminating effective CS teaching practices. Lewis has received the NCWIT.org Undergraduate Mentoring Award and the AnitaB.org Emerging Leader Award for her efforts to broaden participation in computing.
