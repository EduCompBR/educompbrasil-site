          <b>Abstract:</b> Computer science (CS) education research is of growing relevance because of the growing need for computer scientists and an informed public who understands the computational world around them. As a relatively young field, CS and CS education are primed for innovation and impact, and CS education research can be a primary driver of developing effective and equitable CS education. CS education research has important connections with other CS sub-disciplines like HCI, software engineering, and programming languages, and has additional connections to non-CS disciplines like cognitive science, psychology, and education. Drawing from her own and others’ CS education research, Lewis will illustrate recent innovations and impacts from CS education research.
